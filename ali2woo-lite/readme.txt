### Enhance Your Dropshipping Profits with AliExpress's Official Program!
Transform your AliExpress account into a Business Account [using our exclusive invitation link](https://inbusiness.aliexpress.com/web/newCertification?bizScene=STANDARD_SCENE&channel=STANDARD_CHANNEL&invitationCode=2qkht5). This linkage ensures AliExpress recognizes you as a dropshipping partner, opening the door to new earning potentials.
                  
### Compatibility with Woocommerce HPOS
Starting from version 3.1.3, AliNext is compatible with HPOS. 
To activate HPOS, follow these steps: go to Woocommerce -> Settings -> Advanced -> Order data storage and select the "High-performance order storage (recommended)" option. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled the "Enable compatibility mode (synchronizes orders to the posts table)" option. Save your Woocommerce settings and confirm that all orders are synchronized by Woocommerce. If some orders are pending synchronization, you will see information about it there. Please wait until all orders are synchronized before using the AliNext plugin normally. For further information about HPOS [refer official woocommerce article](https://woocommerce.com/posts/platform-update-high-performance-order-storage-for-woocommerce/)

### Important Notice:

- Plugin works based on WooCommerce plugin.

- You have to generate the access token (AliExpress token) to place or sync orders. You don't need the token to import products. Please [follow our instruction](https://help.ali2woo.com/codex/how-to-get-access-token-from-aliexpress/?utm_source=lite&utm_medium=wporg&utm_campaign=alinext-lite) in order to generate token.

- Your permalink structure must NOT be "Plain"

- It is released on WordPress.org and you can use plugin as free to build themes for sale.

### FEATURES
  
&#9658; **Import Products**:

This AliExpress Dropshipping plugin imports products into WooCommerce using a built-in search module or a free Chrome extension. Additionally, it can pull products from selected categories or store pages on AliExpress. Also, if you want to import a specific product only, you can use AliExpress product ID or AliExpress product URL to do that.

- **Import from single product page**

- **Import from category page**

- **Import from store page**

&#9658; **Import All Products of specific AliExpress seller or store**:

The plugin has a separate page allowing you to search for products in specific AliExpress store or seller. Often it helps if you find some store on AliExpress and want to pull all items form the store.

See a detailed guide on this topic [HERE.](https://help.ali2woo.com/codex/how-to-import-all-products-from-the-store/?utm_source=lite&utm_medium=wporg&utm_campaign=alinext-lite)

&#9658; **Load product categories from AliExpress**:

The plugin has a feature to import product categories from AliExpress. It saves you time from having to build the category tree yourself. When the plugin imports the categories, it automatically assigns them to the appropriate imported products.

For further information, please check our [instruction.](https://help.ali2woo.com/alinext-kb/how-to-set-category-for-imported-products/?utm_source=lite&utm_medium=wporg&utm_campaign=alinext-lite)


&#9658; **Split product variants into separate products**:

The plugin allows splitting product variants. For example: a lot of products on AliExpress come with the "ShipFrom" attribute. Often drop shippers don't want to show this variant for customers. With this feature it's possible to split such a product by the "ShipFrom" attribute. As result you will get separate products without it.

Please look through the [this article](https://help.ali2woo.com/codex/how-to-split-product-variants-video/?utm_source=lite&utm_medium=wporg&utm_campaign=alinext-lite) to understand clearly how splitting feature works.

&#9658; **Remove "Ship From" attribute automatically**: save your time, you don’t need to edit the "Shipping From" attribute for each product one by one, AliNext will do that automatically for you!

Check out an article from the plugin Knowledge Base to know [how to use this feature.](https://help.ali2woo.com/codex/how-to-hide-the-ship-from-attribute-from-product-page/?utm_source=lite&utm_medium=wporg&utm_campaign=alinext-lite)

&#9658; **Override product supplier**:

The product override feature is very helpful if you get a new order for the out-of-stock product and want to fulfill the order from another supplier or vendor on AliExpress.
Also it helps if you have a product that was loaded through other dropshipping tool or it was added manually in WooCommerce and you want to connect the product to some AliExpress item using AliNext

Check out an article from the plugin Knowledge Base to know [how to use this feature.](https://ali2woo.com/codex/how-to-change-the-product-supplier/?utm_source=lite&utm_medium=wporg&utm_campaign=alinext-lite)

&#9658; **Change product images through the built-in image editor**:

Have you ever noticed the most product images having seller’s logo on AliExpress? And when you import the products into your store, those watermarks are visible for your customers. We know about such a problem and added a built-in images editor to the plugin`s features. The image tool allows to adjust photos right in your WordPress Dashboard.

It's recommended to check a detailed article [about the image editor tool.](https://help.ali2woo.com/codex/how-to-hide-watermark-on-images-from-aliexpress/?utm_source=lite&utm_medium=wporg&utm_campaign=alinext-lite)

&#9658; **Configure settings for all imported products**:

This set of settings apply to all products imported from AliExpress. Go to AliNext Settings > Common Settings > Import Settings.

- **Language**: Set language of product data such as title, description, variations, attributes, etc. Our plugin supports all languages which available on AliExpress.

- **Currency**: Change the currency of products. AliNext supports all currencies which AliExpress portal operates with. 

- **Default product type**: By default the plugin imports product as "Simple/Variable product". In this case, shoppers will stay on your website when they make a purchase else choose the "External/Affiliate Product" option and your visitors will be redirected to AliExpress to finish the purchase.

- **Default product status**: Choose the "Draft" option and imported products will not be visible on your website frontend.

- **Not import specifications**: Turn this feature on if you'd NOT like to import product attributes from AliExpress. You can see these attributes in the "specifications" tab on the AliExpress website.

- **Not import description**: Enable this feature if you don't want to import product description from AliExpress.

- **Don't import images from the description**: If you want to skip images from the product description and don't import them to the WordPress media library, use this option.

- **Use external image URLs**: By default, the plugin keeps product images on your server. If you want to save free space on your server, 
activate this option and the plugin will load an image using an external AliExpress URL. Please note: This feature works if the plugin is active only!

- **Use random stock value**: By default the plugin imports the original stock level value. Some sellers on AliExpress set very high value and it doesn't look natural. To solve the issue just enable the feature. It forces the plugin to generate stock level value automatically and choose it from a predefined range.

- **Import in the background**: Enable this feature and allow the plugin to import products in a background mode. In this case, each product is loaded in several stages. First, the plugin imports main product data such as: title, description, and attributes, and in the second stage, it imports product images and variants. This feature speeds up the import process extremely. Please note: In the first stage a product is published with the "draft" status and then when all product data is loaded the product status is changed to "published".

- **Allow product duplication**: Allow the import of an already imported product. This can be useful when you want to override a product with the same product.

- **Convert case of attributes and their values**: Products may come with different text case of attributes and their values. Enable this feature to covert all texts to the same case.

- **Remove "Ship From" attribute**: Use this feature to remove the "Ship From" attribute automatically during product import.

&#9658; **Set options related to the order fulfillment process**:

These settings allow changing an order status after the order is placed on AliExpress. Go to AliNext Settings > Common Settings > Order Fulfillment Settings.

- **Delivered Order Status**: Change order status when all order items have been delivered.

- **Shipped Order Status**: Change order status when all order items have been shipped.

- **Placed Order Status**: Change order status when order is placed. 

- **Default shipping method**: If possible, the extension auto-select the shipping method on AliExpress during an order fulfillment process.

- **Override phone number**: The extension will use these phone code and number instead of the real phone provided by your customer.

- **Custom note**: Set a note for a supplier on the AliExpress.

- **Transliteration**: Enable the auto-transliteration of AliExpress order details such as first name, last name, address, etc.

- **Middle name field**: Adds the Middle name field to WooCommerce checkout page in your store. The extension uses the field data during an order-fulfillment process on AliExpress.

On this setting page, you can connect your store to AliExpress Affiliate program. You can connect to the program using your AliExpress, Admitad, or EPN account.

&#9658; **Set up global pricing rules for all products**:

These options allow setting markup over AliExpress prices. You can add separate markup formula for each pricing range. The formula is a rule of a price calculation that includes different math operators such as +, *, =. Pricing rules support three different modes that manage the calculation in your formulas. Additionally, you can add cents to your prices automatically. And even more, it's easy to apply your pricing rules to already imported products.
